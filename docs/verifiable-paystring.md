Verifiable PayString provides enhanced security to the base PayString request and response. Verifiable PayString adds several digital signature fields so you can:

- Link a PayString to one or more external digital identities
- Prove control of the payment rail address
- Provide non-repudiable messaging

With Verifiable PayString, you can enable trust-minimized and trust-free security regimes, which are applicable to both custodial and non-custodial settings.
