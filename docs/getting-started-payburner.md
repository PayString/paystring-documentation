PayString was previously known as PayID, and some references remain.

If you install Payburner, it creates an XRP wallet for you, and it automatically creates a PayString.

Currently, you can install PayBurner as a Chrome or Brave extension, and mobile apps are expected shortly. This quickstart uses the Chrome extension.

This quickstart does not require that you deploy your own server. It is a quick introduction to using PayString as a customer would use it.

## Set up your Payburner PayString

1. Go to [PayBurner](https://payburner.com). Select the option to install PayBurner as a Chrome extension.
2. Open the extension.
3. Create a new account, either with a Payburner extension code, or by buying a code on the payburner.com site. If you have previously created an account, you can import it from the JSON file you saved when you created your wallet. Your wallet opens.

4. To see your PayString, click your avatar on the right and select **My PayString**. You can see both your PayString, and the JSON that defines it.

## Send money with your Payburner PayString to your Xumm XRP wallet

For this exercise, you need another PayString. You can get one if you create another separate Payburner wallet. You can use Xumm to create an XRP wallet also.

If you are using Xumm, you can set up payment from your Payburner PayString address to your Xumm XRP address.

1. Install Xumm from the app store for your phone. Notice the XRP address you get.
2. Open Payburner. Select **Send XRP** from the upper left menu.
3. Enter your XRP address from your Xumm wallet.
4. Enter the amount you want to send. Click **Send**.

If your Payburner account has sufficient funds, and your Xumm account is activated, you will shortly receive the funds.

## Send money from one Payburner PayString to another Payburner PayString

1. Repeat the setup instructions for Payburner PayString to create another PayString.
2. Open **Send XRP** and fill in the address and amount to send.
