The [PayID Validator](https://payidvalidator.com/) is an [open-source project](https://github.com/rswarthout/payid-validator) that helps you verify if your PayID server is following best practices. It checks various HTTP headers, CORS accessibility, response time, and validates your responses using JSON schemas.
