* The [PayID Validator](https://payidvalidator.com/) is an [open-source project](https://github.com/rswarthout/payid-validator) that validates responses using [JSON schemas](https://docs.payid.org/payid-interfaces) and verifies whether your PayID server follows various [best practices](best-practices), like:

    - [HTTP response headers](payid-headers)
    - [Cache-Control](https://docs.payid.org/payid-best-practices#cache-control)
    - [CORS accessibility](https://docs.payid.org/payid-best-practices#set-cors-cross-origin-resource-sharing-headers)
