Verifiable PayID provides enhanced security to the base PayID request and response. Verifiable PayID adds several digital signature fields so you can:

- Link a PayID to one or more external digital identities
- Prove control of the payment rail address
- Provide non-repudiable messaging

With Verifiable PayID, you can enable trust-minimized and trust-free security regimes, which are applicable to both custodial and non-custodial settings.
