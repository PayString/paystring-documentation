When you want to experiment with or deploy a PayString server, you have several options.

- To experiment without deploying a server, use the [PayString Sandbox](https://paystring.org/sandbox).

- [Deploy Locally Without Docker](local-deployment)

- [Deploy a PayString server on AWS with NGINX reverse proxy](remote-deployment)

- [Deploy on AWS Lambda](aws-lambda-deploy)

You can use the same principles to deploy a PayString server on other cloud providers, or on your own machines. See the suggested [requirements](payid-server-requirements).

When you have set up your PayString server, you can also configure an [NGINX reverse proxy and SSL](nginx-ssl-deploy) to improve load bearing and security.
