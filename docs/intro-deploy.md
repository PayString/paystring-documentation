When you want to experiment with or deploy a PayID server, you have several options.

- To experiment without deploying a server, use the [PayID Sandbox](https://payid.org/sandbox).

- [Deploy Locally Without Docker](local-deployment)

- [Deploy a PayID server on AWS with NGINX reverse proxy](remote-deployment)

- [Deploy on AWS Lambda](aws-lambda-deploy)

You can use the same principles to deploy a PayID server on other cloud providers, or on your own machines. See the suggested [requirements](payid-server-requirements).
